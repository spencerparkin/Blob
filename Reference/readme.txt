This is an old program I wrote many, many years ago, as can be realized from the programming style and formatting.  Rather arrogently, I suppose, I thought I could resurrect the idea of the program in a more perfect, modern form, having programmed now as a trade all these years.  I must admit, however, that I have, in my attempt, utterly and completely failed to duplicate the success of this old program.  It's simulation is far more stable and convincing than what I have worked so hard to create over the past few weeks.  It's really quite demoralizing.  I can only conclude that the older I get, not only the fatter, but dumber too.
